# About this document

Here, we present the results of the randomised controlled trial conducted in
Madrid and Catalonia, as part of the activities of the RESPOND - Healthcare
workers study ([RESPOND-HCW](www.respond-project.eu)). Roberto Mediavilla wrote
the code and prepare the results between between September and October, 2022.
Iago GinÃ© run the analyses independently replicated the results. Federico
Tedeschi wrote the Statistical Analysis Plan, with the input of the RESPOND
consortium.

We used the following scripts to run all the analyses.

```{r req scr, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("src/req_pack.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
source("R/respond_functions.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
source("src/data_cleaning.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
source("src/main_analysis.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
source("src/secondary_analysis.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
```

All the scripts are available in this repository. In compliance with the
European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we do not share any
dataset to avoid disclosure of participants' personal data,

## Missing data

The number of people who did not report the primary outcome is
`r ds_long %>% filter(time == "2" & is.na(phqads_t)) %>% count() %>% as.numeric()`
at T2,
`r ds_long %>% filter(time == "3" & is.na(phqads_t)) %>% count() %>% as.numeric()`
at T3 and
`r ds_long %>% filter(time == "4" & is.na(phqads_t)) %>% count() %>% as.numeric()`
at T4. Sociodemographic characteristics at baseline are available for all
participants, as well as the primary outcome measure.<br> <br> The proportion of
missing data at the primary endpoint (T4) varies across gender (male \> female)
and across job types (lowest among physicians).<br>

<br>

The number of days elapsed between assessments is slightly larger on (a) the
intervention arm and (b) the Barcelona site (SJD), especially at T3. The median
differences range between 2 and 10 days.<br>

<br>

```{r time bt assessments, echo = FALSE}
ds_long %>%
  group_by(institute_abbreviation,
           castor_record_id,
           randomization_group,
           time) %>%
  mutate(
    survey_completed_on = date(survey_completed_on)
  ) %>%
  select(institute_abbreviation,
         randomization_group,
         time,
         survey_completed_on) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "time",
              values_from = "survey_completed_on",
              names_prefix = "t") %>%
  mutate(
    t2_days = t2 - t1,
    t3_days = t3 - t1,
    t4_days = t4 - t1
  ) %>%
  group_by(randomization_group,
           institute_abbreviation) %>%
  summarise(
    t2_median = median(t2_days, na.rm = T),
    t3_median = median(t3_days, na.rm = T),
    t4_median = median(t4_days, na.rm = T)
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = contains("median"),
               names_to = c("time", ".values"),
               names_sep = "_") %>%
  arrange(time) %>%
  kable(caption = "Time elapsed from baseline to follow-up assessments")
```

## Adverse events

Only three participants reported suicidal thoughts during the assessments of the
trial. Please note that one participant reported suicidal thoughts during the
baseline assessment. We did not exclude him/her because the answer to the
suicide screening question (suicidal thoughts in the last *two weeks*) was "no".
We contacted this person after baseline assessment and we checked that he/she
had experienced suicidal thoughts *three or four weeks* before screening.<br>

<br>

```{r adverse, echo = FALSE}
ds_long %>% 
  filter(sbs_1 == "Yes") %>% 
  select(castor_record_id,
         institute_abbreviation,
         time) %>% 
  mutate(anon_id = as_factor(castor_record_id) %>% 
           fct_anon()) %>% 
  relocate(anon_id) %>% 
  select(!castor_record_id) %>% 
  mutate(time = fct_recode(time,
                           "T1. Baseline" = "1",
                           "T2. Week 7 (post DWM)" = "2",
                           "T4. Week 21 (follow-up)" = "4")) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Adverse events")
```

# Main results

Here, we present the flowchart of the participants. All randomised participants
were included in the main analysis (i.e., intention-to-treat analysis). <br>

```{r trialover fig, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", fig.cap="Figure. Participants' flowchart", echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(path = "www/trial_overview.png")
```

This figure shows an overview of the stepped-care format. All randomised
participants (n = 115) were offered the first intervention (Doing What Matters
[DWM]). At week 7, we screened participants to see if they still scored above
the cut-off score on the K-10 scale, which measures psychological distress.
Thirteen (11%) had moved from above to below the cut-off, and were therefore not
offered to step up. Sixteen (14%) did not complete the screening despite being
reminded about it, and were not offered to step up either. The remaining
participants (n = 86, 75%) were asked to do the second intervention (Problem
Management Plus [PM+)]). <br>

```{r steppedcare fig, fig.align='center', out.width="60%", fig.cap="Figure. Stepped care overview", echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(path = "www/steppedcare_overview.png")
```

<br>

The characteristics of the participants are presented below. Participants were
mostly highly educated women who worked as physicians or nurses. Most of them
had been exposed directly to COVID-19 patients since the beginning of the
pandemic (i.e., "frontline workers"). <br>

```{r t1, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
gtsummary::as_kable_extra(table1)
```

<br>

Below, we present the main outcomes of the study. All scores decrease over time
in both groups. <br>

```{r t2, echo = FALSE}
gtsummary::as_kable_extra(table2)
```

<br>

We conducted a linear mixed model to explore the effect of the randomisation
group on the mental health outcomes over time (please note that participants
were included in the model as random effects). We provide estimated marginal
means and robust 95 percent confidence intervals, both crude and adjusted, for
the primary and secondary outcome measures. The results are compatible with our
hypothesis that the improvement in mental health outcomes would be larger among
individuals randomised to the Intervention arm.<br>

```{r emm plot, out.width="90%", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}

```

<br>

```{r t3, echo = FALSE}
models_ds_long$main_summary %>% knit_print()
```

<br>

```{r es plot, out.width="90%", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}

```

# Secondary analyses

### Additional information ITT analyses

This plot shows the change in the K10 score (X axis) from baseline to the first
follow-up assessment (after DWM) at the participant-level (Y axis). There are
more people who improve in the Intervention arm (frequency of green lines),
improvements are larger (length of green lines), and more people screened out
(observations falling in the grey area), than in the Control arm. <br>

```{r k10 plot, echo = FALSE}
plots_ds_long$k10_plot
```

<br>

This table includes the raw data of the models (just in case something very
specific needs to be checked)

```{r full model description, echo = FALSE}
models_ds_long$full_summary %>% 
  mutate(
    across(
      where(is.numeric),
      round, 2))
```

### Modified per-protocol analyses

Per-protocol analyses include all participants in the control arm and those
participants in the intervention arm who completed the full intervention
programme -in our case, that means fully clicking through at least three modules
in DWM and attending at least four PM+ sessions (only for participants who
stepped up). We found that `r count(completers_dwm_only) %>% as.numeric()` were
DWM-only completers and `r count(completers_dwm_pm) %>% as.numeric()` DWM-PM
completers. <br>

```{r pp desc, echo = FALSE}
ds_long_pp %>% 
  filter(time==1) %>% 
  group_by(randomization_group) %>% 
  count()
```

<br>

We replicated the ITT models on this population, i.e., a linear mixed model to
explore the effect of the randomisation group on the mental health outcomes over
time (please note that participants were included in the model as random
effects). We provide estimated marginal means and robust 95 percent confidence
intervals, both crude and adjusted, for the primary and secondary outcome
measures. The results are compatible with our hypothesis that the improvement in
mental health outcomes would be larger among individuals randomised to the
Intervention arm. The results are also similar to those of the main analysis,
suggesting robustness. <br>

```{r emm plot pp, out.width="90%", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
models_ds_long_pp$phqads_plot
```

<br>

```{r t3 pp, echo = FALSE}
models_ds_long_pp$main_summary %>% knit_print()
```

<br>

```{r es plot pp, out.width="90%", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
models_ds_long_pp$cohen_plot
```

### Sensitivity: Distressed participants

Here, we include only the participants who scored above threshold on the PHQ-9
and/or the GAD-7 at baseline.

```{r sev desc, echo = FALSE}
ds_long_sev %>% 
  filter(time == "1") %>% 
  group_by(randomization_group) %>% 
  count()
```

<br>

We replicated the ITT models on this population, i.e., a linear mixed model to
explore the effect of the randomisation group on the mental health outcomes over
time (please note that participants were included in the model as random
effects). We provide estimated marginal means and robust 95 percent confidence
intervals, both crude and adjusted, for the primary and secondary outcome
measures. The results are compatible with our hypothesis that the improvement in
mental health outcomes would be larger among individuals randomised to the
Intervention arm. The results are also similar to those of the main analysis,
suggesting robustness. <br>

```{r emm plot sev, out.width="90%", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
models_ds_long_sev$phqads_plot
```

<br>

```{r t3 sev, echo = FALSE}
models_ds_long_sev$main_summary %>% knit_print()
```

<br>

```{r es plot sev, out.width="90%", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
models_ds_long_sev$cohen_plot
```

### Sensitivity: Binary outcomes

We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 well-stablished
cut-off scores (score \> 9). Since the PHQ-ADS does not provide a validated
cut-off, we calculated a dichotomous score based on both the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7
cut-offs. If participants scored below 10 on *both the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7*,
then they scored below threshold on the PHQ-ADS, whereas if they scored equal or
higher than 10 *either on the PHQ-9 or/and the GAD-7*, they scored above
threshold on the PHQ-ADS.

```{r summary bin, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
main_summary_log
```

<br>

We also calculated the number-needed-to-treat (NNT) for the three dichotomous
outcomes. .

```{r nnt, echo=TRUE}
# PHQ-ADS

nnt_phqads

#PHQ-9

nnt_phq9

# GAD-7

nnt_gad7
```

### Sensitivity: Complete-case analysis

We conducted a sensitivity analysis including only the participants who
completed all assessments (i.e., a complete-case analysis).

```{r com desc, echo = FALSE}
ds_long_com %>% 
  filter(time == "1") %>% 
  group_by(randomization_group) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  kable(caption = "Number of participants in sensitivity analysis")
```

<br>

We replicated the ITT models on this population, i.e., a linear mixed model to
explore the effect of the randomisation group on the mental health outcomes over
time (please note that participants were included in the model as random
effects). We provide estimated marginal means and robust 95 percent confidence
intervals, both crude and adjusted, for the primary and secondary outcome
measures. The results are compatible with our hypothesis that the improvement in
mental health outcomes would be larger among individuals randomised to the
Intervention arm. The results are also similar to those of the main analysis,
suggesting robustness, although estimates appear to be a bit lower. <br>

```{r emm plot com, out.width="90%", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
models_ds_long_com$phqads_plot
```

<br>

```{r t3 com, echo = FALSE}
models_ds_long_com$main_summary %>% knit_print()
```

<br>

```{r es plot com, out.width="90%", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
models_ds_long_com$cohen_plot
```

### Adherence to intervention protocols

We tested whether intervention providers (i.e., helpers) adhered to the
intervention protocols. <br>

```{r plot adh mad, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure. Adherence in Madrid"}
plot_adh_mad
```

<br>

```{r plot adh bcn, out.width="80%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure. Adherence in Catalonia"}
plot_adh_bcn
```

<br>

```{r adh checklists mad, echo = FALSE}
dwm_mad_check_tbl
pm_mad_check_tbl
```

```{r adh checklists bcn, echo = FALSE}
dwm_bcn_check_tbl
pm_bcn_check_tbl
```

### Cronbach's alpha

Our instruments show high Cronbachs' alphas at baseline. <br>

```{r cronbach, echo = TRUE}
# PHQ-9
ds_long %>% 
  filter(time == 1) %>% 
  select(phq9_01:phq9_09) %>% 
  psych::alpha()

# GAD-7

ds_long %>% 
  filter(time == 1) %>% 
  select(gad7_1:gad7_7) %>% 
  psych::alpha()

# PCL-5

ds_long %>% 
  filter(time == 1) %>% 
  select(pcl5_1:pcl5_8) %>% 
  psych::alpha()

# PHQ-ADS

ds_long %>% 
  filter(time == 1) %>% 
  select(starts_with(c("phq", "gad"))) %>% 
  select(!c(phq9_10,
            phq9_t, 
            phq9_cut, 
            phq9_cat, 
            gad7_t, 
            gad7_cut, 
            phqads_t, 
            phqads_cat, 
            phqads_cut)) %>% 
  psych::alpha()
```
